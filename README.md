## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice fundamental JavaScript skills, specifically in DOM manipulation and event handling. It provides a simple interactive example of how JavaScript can be used to update content dynamically based on user actions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- FontAwesome for icons

## How to Use

1. Click the plus button (+) to increment the counter.
2. Click the minus button (-) to decrement the counter.
3. The current counter value is displayed in the center of the screen.

## Future Improvements

- Implement animations for smoother counter updates.
- Add functionality to prevent the counter from going below zero.
- Include a reset button to set the counter value back to zero.
- Implement local storage to persist the counter value between page reloads.

Feel free to clone this repository and explore the code to understand how basic JavaScript functions are used to achieve the counter functionality.
